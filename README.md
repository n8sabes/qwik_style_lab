# Qwik Style Lab ⚡️

This style lab demonstrates:

1. Style scoping in Qwik, what works and what does not
2. The `CSS$( )` lazy loadable styles.
3. `useStyleScopeId()` is just as important as `useId()`

## This is about WHOLE STYLE
This is about scoping a WHOLE STYLE including its dependencies not 'atomic style' as defined elsewhere. The use of the word atomic here means "all the pieces" that make up a style, inclusive of selectors (classnames and ids), @keyframe and @media query at-rules.

[Video Explanation 1 - Namespace for all selectors and at-rules]()

[Video Explanation 2 - CSS$ default styles]()

[Video Explanation 3 - useStyleScopeId()]()
